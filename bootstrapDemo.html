            <h3>OUNDLE RFC</h3>
            <p><em>We Love Ruggers!</em></p>
            <p>Back in 1976, when flares were an acceptable fashion item, a group of rugby enthusiasts met at the Ship to form Oundle Rugby Club. Many founder members are still involved in the club and were players in Oundle's first cup match, losing to Kettering 137:0 - still a club record loss. And in those days tries were only worth 3 points!

                Then, as now, any work that needed doing required a 'work party". Such a group subsequently dismantled the old Tea room at Thorney Wildlife Park, transported it to Oundle and reassembled it as our first Clubhouse in Occupation Road. It has been extended over the years; the half nearest the second team pitch being the original building. Looking back, given the state of many of those founder members were in after a Saturday of rugby and beer it's astonishing it's still standing. But perhaps that's testimony to the maintenance work of subsequent "work parties" over the intervening years.
                
                Membership of the club, which is open to anyone, stands at more that 350 family and individual members. At Senior level we will field four teams - Firsts, Seconds, Colts and Vets. On Sundays Oundle will again consolidate its reputation as one of the Midlands most successful Mini and Junior sections. Youth is still the lifeblood of the Club, and we can proudly claim to have set several players on the path to achieving higher honours in Premier Division and International Rugby.
                
                We are proud of the recent developments to the clubhouse and it is now a wonderful social facility. Members are free to make use of the bar, ample space to meet and greet friends and friends they haven't met yet. Our focus is now on playing, the pitches and getting the standard to the next level. We have come a long way since 1976 and much of this has been due to the dedication and commitment of the unsung heroes - past and present Council members, coaches, organisers, bar, kitchen staff and anyone who has ever served on a committee or work party. We welcome that spirit. So come on step forward and offer to do your bit. The more you put in the more enjoyment you'll get out of it!!</p>
